# ADP-01: Arcadestr Distribution Protocol

`draft` `optional`

A minimal, open HTTP protocol for serving gated digital game files, using Nostr identities and event kinds as the authentication and ownership layer. Any operator can run a compliant ADP server; game developers choose which servers carry their builds. Ownership is proven via a [NIP‑102](NIP-102.md) `kind:1020` receipt, signed either by the developer's own key or by a key the developer has delegated for fulfillment. This credential is portable across servers and does not depend on any single server remaining online.

ADP is modeled after [Blossom](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom): servers are interchangeable, the protocol is the contract, and no central operator is privileged.

## Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **ADP server** | An HTTP server implementing this spec |
| **Developer** | The Nostr keypair that signed the game's [NIP‑99](99.md) listing event |
| **Fulfillment key** | A Nostr keypair authorized through a developer-signed `kind:30406` lifecycle for explicit operational capabilities |
| **Operator** | The party running an ADP server. May serve a single developer (including a developer running it for themselves) or many — an operator serving multiple developers issues each a distinct fulfillment key via [Provisioning](#provisioning-endpoints), never a key shared across unrelated developers. Identified by the same pubkey that signs its `kind:30403` announcement. |
| **Scope** | An optional label a developer attaches to a provisioning request, letting the same operator hold multiple independent fulfillment keys for the same developer (e.g. one per game, for isolation). Bookkeeping only — has no bearing on receipt verification. |
| **Game coordinate** | `30402:<developer-pubkey>:<d-tag>` — the stable identifier for a listing |
| **Buyer** | The Nostr keypair that completed payment |
| **LSP** | Lightning Service Provider — the operator of the LNURL-pay endpoint that signs `kind:9735` zap receipts on a developer's behalf, resolved from a listing's `lud16` tag |

## Canonical Hex Encoding

Every hex-encoded value defined by this specification — `file_hash`, `fulfillment_pubkey`, authorization root and attestation event IDs, payment-proof event IDs, and any other field documented as `<...-hex>` or `<hex>` — MUST be **lowercase**. SHA‑256 digests, event IDs, and x-only public keys are 64 lowercase hex characters.

This matches NIP‑01, under which event IDs and public keys are already lowercase hex, and requires no change from any implementation using conventional hex encoding.

**Consumers MUST reject a non-lowercase value rather than normalizing it.** Uppercase is not an alternative encoding of the same value; it is invalid input. Servers, clients, and relays MUST NOT case-fold on read, MUST NOT compare case-insensitively, and MUST NOT accept a value that differs from its canonical form.

The reason is identity, not tidiness. `file_hash` keys stored artifacts and is compared byte-for-byte during upload verification, periodic re-verification, and post-download integrity checks. If two spellings of one digest are both accepted, they are two identities for one artifact: deduplication fails, one stored copy can satisfy a lookup while the other does not, and an implementation that normalizes on read interoperates inconsistently with one that does not. Rejecting is the only rule under which all participants agree on what a value *is*.

Normalization belongs at the human input boundary and nowhere else. A publishing client MAY lowercase a hash pasted or typed by a person, or carried over from a prior listing revision, before validating it. Having validated, it MUST emit the canonical form. Values arriving from another participant — a signed event, an HTTP request or response, a database — are never normalized; they are accepted as canonical or rejected.

This rule constrains hex-encoded values only. Bech32 identifiers (`npub`, `note`, `naddr`) have their own canonical form defined by NIP‑19, and `lud16` is an address, not an encoding.

## Listing Extensions (`kind:30402`)

A developer distributing a game via ADP adds the following tags to their [NIP‑99](99.md) classified listing:

| Tag | Value | Description |
|-----|-------|--------------|
| `server` | `<https-url>` | Declares a server authorized to distribute this listing's file. Repeatable. |
| `file_hash` | `<sha256-hex>` | SHA‑256 of the game archive, 64 lowercase hex characters — see [Canonical Hex Encoding](#canonical-hex-encoding). Servers MUST verify stored files against this hash before serving. |
| `version` | `<semver-string>` | Build version. |
| `platform` | `<os>-<arch>` | Optional; a listing per platform is the simplest model. |
| `fulfillment_authorization` | `<authorization-root-event-id>`, `<fulfillment-pubkey>`, `<relay-hint>` | Enables new operations under the referenced `kind:30406` authorization. Repeatable; relay hint optional. The authorization chain, not the listing, owns validity and capabilities. |
| `lud16` | `<name@domain>` | The Lightning address whose LNURL-pay endpoint is authoritative for this listing's purchases. Required if the listing accepts the zap-receipt payment proof path (not required if only bolt11/preimage proof is ever used). MUST be read from this tag, never from the developer's `kind:0` profile — see [LSP Verification](#lsp-verification-lud16). |
| `adp_terms` | `<operator-pubkey>`, `<kind-1032-root-event-id>` | Developer acceptance of one exact immutable experimental commercial-terms root. Repeatable once per distinct sale-time operator. Separate from `kind:30406` operational authority. |

### Example Event

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 30402,
  "pubkey": "<developer-pubkey>",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "my-game-v1"],
    ["server", "https://dist.arcadestr.io"],
    ["file_hash", "a3f5...":],
    ["version", "1.0.0"],
    ["platform", "linux-x86_64"],
    ["fulfillment_authorization", "<authorization-root-1>", "a1b2...", "wss://relay.example.com"],
    ["fulfillment_authorization", "<authorization-root-2>", "c3d4..."],
    ["lud16", "studio@getalby.com"]
  ],
  "content": "...",
  "sig": "<developer-signature>"
}
```

`server` tags declare **distribution authorization only** — which servers may serve the file. They are independent of ownership and fulfillment-key authorization; see [Distribution Authorization](#distribution-authorization) below.

### Mandatory fields for client-published listings

Nothing in this section is a protocol-level restriction — any Nostr client can publish a `kind:30402` event with any subset of these tags, and relays MUST accept it regardless. This is guidance for a **publishing client's own UI**, not a wire-format requirement: a client that wants a listing to be immediately usable through ADP SHOULD enforce the following before allowing publish, and MUST clearly communicate to the buyer-facing side of the client when a listing lacks them, rather than silently degrading.

Two tiers, since they fail differently:

- **Payment-address tier — required for any priced listing, independent of ADP entirely:** `lud16`. Every priced listing needs a payment address regardless of whether ADP is involved; ADP additionally requires it be resolvable and stable per [LSP Verification](#lsp-verification-lud16), so a client SHOULD treat it as mandatory at publish time rather than optional.
- **Fulfillment tier — required only for listings that want automated install/download:** `file_hash`, `server` (≥1), and at least one applicable `fulfillment_authorization` unless the developer signs every operation directly. A listing missing these can still be a valid, purchasable listing — it simply cannot support one-click install, and a client SHOULD render it accordingly (e.g. Buy-only, no Install action), the same way an unsupported platform is already handled.

A publishing client enforcing the fulfillment tier SHOULD, before allowing submit:

1. Compute `file_hash` client-side from the selected build file rather than accepting it as freeform text — a hand-typed hash is a guaranteed source of publish/upload mismatches.
   Where a hash is nonetheless carried over from a prior revision or supplied by a person, lowercase it at capture and then validate it strictly; a listing published with a non-canonical hash will be rejected by both the upload path and the buyer's verification, having appeared valid at publish time.
2. For direct developer signing, no fulfillment authorization is required. For delegated operation, the client calls `POST /provision`, verifies the matching operator-signed `kind:30404`, creates or reuses a coordinate-scoped `kind:30406` authorization root with explicit capabilities, publishes it, and adds the corresponding `fulfillment_authorization` listing tag.
3. For each declared `server` URL, fetch `GET <server>/.well-known/adp` live as a basic reachability check. This confirms the URL is live and *a* server, but is not a substitute for step 2 — a server's single announced identity pubkey has no fixed relationship to any individual developer's delegated fulfillment key once an operator serves more than one developer.

A listing published through a different tool, without these fields, is not invalid — it is simply outside what this client's automated fulfillment can act on. Sellers who wish to use a different publishing interface and still support ADP fulfillment need to supply these fields by whatever means that interface offers (manual tag entry, a companion tool, etc.); this spec does not mandate any particular publishing UI.

## The `kind:30403` Server Announcement Event

ADP servers publish a parameterized replaceable event to announce themselves. Clients and developers query relays for `kind:30403` to discover available servers.

| Tag | Value | Description |
|-----|-------|--------------|
| `d` | `<server-slug>` | Replaceable-event identifier |
| `name` | Human-readable server name | |
| `url` | `<https-url>` | Base URL for HTTP endpoints |
| `supported_adp` | `<semver-string>` | ADP protocol version supported |
| `contact` | Free text | Operator contact |

### Example Event

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 30403,
  "pubkey": "<server-pubkey>",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "arcadestr-dist"],
    ["name", "Arcadestr Official Distribution"],
    ["url", "https://dist.arcadestr.io"],
    ["supported_adp", "0.2.0"],
    ["contact", "ops@arcadestr.io"]
  ],
  "content": "",
  "sig": "..."
}
```

## Fulfillment Authorization

A delegated fulfillment key derives authority from a developer-signed `kind:30406` authorization lifecycle. The current listing only enables an authorization for new operations; it does not contain or duplicate the lifecycle's validity timestamps.

A listing may enable multiple active authorizations:

```text
["fulfillment_authorization", "<authorization-root-id>", "<fulfillment-pubkey>", "<relay-hint>"]
```

The relay hint is optional. The root ID and fulfillment pubkey are both included so clients can reject mismatched references before graph traversal.

### Scoped capabilities

Each authorization root MUST contain at least one recognized capability. This version defines:

- `issue_receipt` — sign a NIP-102 root receipt;
- `issue_grant` — sign an Entitlement Grant root under an independently valid campaign or issuance policy;
- `upload_build` — authenticate and upload a build for the coordinate.

Capabilities are explicit and fail closed. Unknown capability values grant no authority. Capabilities are invariant across an authorization chain; adding, removing, or changing capabilities requires a new authorization root. Cancellation affects every capability in that root.

### Current issuance versus historical verification

A new delegated operation at time `T` requires both:

1. the current listing contains a matching `fulfillment_authorization` tag; and
2. the referenced authorization chain is active at `T` and contains the required capability.

A previously issued delegated credential remains valid without current listing membership when:

1. it contains `['authorization', '<root-id>']`;
2. its signer matches the fulfillment key in that root;
3. the root is bound to the same developer and game coordinate;
4. the authorization was active and had the required capability at the credential root's `created_at`.

Removing an authorization from a replacement listing prevents new issuance but MUST NOT retroactively invalidate credentials created while it was active.

Direct developer-signed receipts, grants, and uploads require no `kind:30406` event and delegated credentials without an `authorization` tag are invalid. No legacy listing-delegation fallback is defined.

### Fulfillment Provisioning Attestation (`kind:30404`)

`kind:30404` remains an operator-signed, parameterized replaceable attestation that the operator provisioned and claims possession of a fulfillment key for a developer. It is checked during provisioning and authorization creation, but ordinary historical credential verification relies on the developer-signed `kind:30406` lifecycle.

A matching `30404` MUST name the same operator, developer, and fulfillment key before a publishing client creates a delegated authorization. Operator revocation means the operator claims it no longer holds or uses the key; it does not retroactively invalidate credentials and does not replace developer cancellation of `30406`.

### Fulfillment Authorization (`kind:30406`)

`kind:30406` is a **regular, non-replaceable** developer-signed authorization event. A root and its chained updates form an append-only lifecycle.

#### Root tags

| Tag | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `d` | `<authorization-id>` | Stable authorization identifier, SHOULD be UUID v4. Required and preserved. |
| `a` | `30402:<developer-pubkey>:<d-tag>` | Exact game coordinate. Required and preserved. |
| `p` | `<operator-pubkey>` | Operator holding the fulfillment key. Required and preserved. |
| `fulfillment_pubkey` | `<pubkey-hex>` | Authorized operational key. Required and preserved. |
| `capability` | `issue_receipt` \| `issue_grant` \| `upload_build` | Repeatable; at least one required and preserved. |
| `valid_from` | `<unix-seconds>` | Inclusive beginning of authority. Required and preserved. MUST NOT precede the root's `created_at`. |
| `status` | `active` \| `cancelled` | Root MUST use `active`. |
| `e` | `<immediate-predecessor-id>` | Absent on root; exactly one on updates. |

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 30406,
  "pubkey": "<developer-pubkey>",
  "created_at": 1700000000,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<authorization-id>"],
    ["a", "30402:<developer-pubkey>:my-game-v1"],
    ["p", "<operator-pubkey>"],
    ["fulfillment_pubkey", "<fulfillment-pubkey>"],
    ["capability", "issue_receipt"],
    ["capability", "issue_grant"],
    ["capability", "upload_build"],
    ["valid_from", "1700000000"],
    ["status", "active"]
  ],
  "content": "",
  "sig": "<developer-signature>"
}
```

#### Cancellation

An update may only cancel the authorization. It MUST preserve `d`, `a`, `p`, `fulfillment_pubkey`, all `capability` values, and `valid_from`; contain exactly one immediate predecessor `e`; and use `status: cancelled`.

Cancellation is prospective:

```text
effective_cancelled_at = cancellation_event.created_at
```

A credential created before that timestamp remains valid. A credential created at or after it is unauthorized. Backdated cancellation fields are not defined or accepted.

#### Chain resolution

Authorization chains use the valid-prefix model:

- an event joins the valid chain only when its signature, invariant fields, transition, and immediate predecessor are valid;
- an invalid event does not alter state and is excluded from valid-successor fork analysis;
- descendants through an invalid event are unreachable;
- the developer may recover with a valid sibling referencing the last valid tip;
- multiple valid successors of one valid predecessor are a fork and fail closed;
- cycles and self-references are invalid;
- verifiers MUST NOT resolve ambiguity by `created_at`.

The authorization is active at time `T` when `valid_from <= T` and no valid cancellation has `created_at <= T`.

### Relay availability

A verifier MUST distinguish invalid authorization from insufficient evidence. An invalid, mismatched, or cancelled chain is rejected. Incomplete relay coverage or a missing required predecessor produces an indeterminate/unavailable result, not a declaration that the credential is cryptographically unauthorized.

#### Positive and negative evidence are not symmetric

**Positive evidence is self-validating.** A signature-verified event from any single relay establishes what it attests. It does not become more true because a second relay also returned it, and a relay that did not answer cannot make it false. A verifier that has received a valid, signature-verified event satisfying a query MUST NOT treat the result as unavailable because fewer relays responded than some threshold.

**Negative evidence requires corroboration.** Absence proves nothing from one relay: a relay may not carry the event, may have dropped it, or may be selectively withholding it. Concluding that something does not exist requires coverage a verifier can justify, and a deployment MAY set a minimum for it.

Therefore a verifier MUST select from valid candidates found among completed responses **before** applying any completeness threshold. The threshold governs whether an absence is conclusive, never whether a present event counts.

This is a deliberate availability trade, and its cost should be stated: a relay that did not answer may hold a newer revision of a replaceable event, so a verifier acting on the best evidence it received may act on a superseded revision. That is the better failure. An installation pins the snapshot it resolved and a superseded revision is recoverable by updating; an install blocked because one of several relays was unreachable is not recoverable at all, and it makes availability depend on the least available relay rather than the most available one — inverting the redundancy relays exist to provide.

Where multiple valid candidates are found, replaceable-event ordering applies as normal. Selecting available positive evidence does not mean accepting the first response without considering others that completed.

## LSP Verification (`lud16`)

Confirming a `kind:9735` zap receipt's signature and its `p`/`a` tag references is not sufficient proof of payment on its own — those checks alone accept any self-signed event with the right shape. A server MUST additionally confirm the receipt was signed by the listing's actual Lightning Service Provider (LSP), resolved as follows:

1. Read the listing's `lud16` tag (`name@domain`).
2. Resolve it to an LNURL-pay endpoint per [LUD-16](https://github.com/lnurl/luds/blob/luds/16.md): `https://<domain>/.well-known/lnurlp/<name>`.
3. Fetch the endpoint and extract its declared `nostrPubkey`, per [NIP‑57](57.md)'s zap metadata requirements.
4. Require `zap_receipt.pubkey == nostrPubkey`.

This resolution **MUST** use the `lud16` tag on the listing event itself — **never** a fallback to the developer's `kind:0` profile metadata. A listing's `lud16` is the single, self-contained source of payment-routing authority for that listing, consistent with how `file_hash`, `server`, and `fulfillment_authorization` are already scoped to the listing rather than to a separately mutable profile event. A developer who changes their profile `lud16` does not thereby change which LSP is authoritative for an already-published listing; they must republish the listing to change it.

If a listing has no `lud16` tag, the zap-receipt payment path MUST NOT be accepted for it — this is a hard failure (`402`), not a silent skip of the LSP check. The bolt11/preimage self-contained proof path has no LSP-trust dependency and remains available regardless.

## HTTP Endpoints

All endpoints requiring authentication use `Authorization: Nostr <base64-nip98-event>` per [NIP‑98](98.md).

### NIP-98 `u` tag comparison

A server verifying a NIP-98 token MUST compare the token's `u` tag against a target constructed as:

- **scheme and authority** from the server's own configured external origin;
- **path and query** taken verbatim from the raw request target, exactly as transmitted.

The comparison is exact. A server MUST NOT percent-decode either side before comparing, MUST NOT normalize trailing slashes, and MUST NOT reconstruct the path from decoded route parameters.

Game coordinates contain colons (`30402:<pubkey>:<d-tag>`). Colons are legal unencoded in a path segment per RFC 3986, so percent-encoding them is optional — which means a decoded and an encoded form of the same coordinate are both valid URLs that do not compare equal as strings. Without this rule, a client and a server can each choose a defensible form and never interoperate. Taking the path verbatim from the request removes the choice: whatever the client transmitted is what the client must have signed.

Scheme and authority come from configuration rather than from the request because `Host` and forwarding headers are attacker-controlled. A server MUST NOT derive them from request headers. A deployment behind a reverse proxy MUST configure its external origin to match the origin clients address; a mismatch there is a configuration error and MUST fail closed.

The origin is part of the comparison, not omitted. A `u` tag binding only a path would let an authorization signed for one server be replayed against another serving the same coordinate, within its validity window — a live risk in this protocol precisely because servers are interchangeable and multiple servers deliberately serve the same content.

### `GET /.well-known/adp`

Public. No auth required.

**Response `200`:**
```json
{
  "adp_version": "0.2.0",
  "pubkey": "<server-pubkey>",
  "name": "Arcadestr Official Distribution",
  "url": "https://dist.arcadestr.io"
}
```

### Provisioning Endpoints

These exist so any developer can onboard to any ADP-compliant hosted operator through the same flow, rather than each operator inventing its own bespoke API — the same interoperability goal that motivates every other part of this spec.

### `POST /provision`

Developer-authenticated. Requests the operator provision (or return an existing) fulfillment key for the calling developer, optionally scoped for per-game key isolation.

**Auth:** NIP‑98 token. The developer's identity comes from the token, never the request body.

**Request body (`application/json`):**
```json
{
  "scope": "my-game-slug"
}
```
`scope` is optional; omit it to request a default, unscoped key.

**Server MUST:**
1. Verify the NIP‑98 token.
2. Check whether an active key already exists for `(developer_pubkey, scope)`. If so, return it unchanged — this endpoint is idempotent, not a mint-on-every-call.
3. Otherwise, generate a new keypair dedicated to this `(developer_pubkey, scope)` pair. A key MUST NOT be reused across different developers, and MUST NOT be reused across different scopes requested by the same developer.
4. Publish a `kind:30404` attestation for `(developer_pubkey, fulfillment_pubkey)` with `valid_from` set to now, including the `scope` tag if one was given.
5. Persist the mapping, with the private key encrypted at rest (see [Security Considerations](#security-considerations)).

**Response `200`:**
```json
{
  "fulfillment_pubkey": "<hex>",
  "attestation_event_id": "<hex>",
  "scope": "my-game-slug"
}
```

The operator never constructs or publishes `kind:30406`; the developer client creates the coordinate-scoped authorization with explicit capabilities after validating the operator attestation.

### `POST /provision/revoke`

Developer-authenticated. Requests the operator stop holding and using a previously provisioned key.

**Auth:** NIP‑98 token. The server MUST confirm the calling developer owns the named key per its own records before acting.

**Request body (`application/json`):**
```json
{
  "fulfillment_pubkey": "<hex>"
}
```

**Server MUST:**
1. Republish the corresponding `kind:30404` with `revoked_at` set to now.
2. Cease signing anything new with this key, and SHOULD securely delete or rotate it out of active storage.

**This endpoint is operational evidence only.** It stops this operator from using the key and updates `30404`; developer cancellation of the corresponding `30406` is the normative prospective authorization revocation. Existing earlier credentials remain valid.

### Upload capacity discovery

`GET /.well-known/adp` MAY include `max_upload_bytes`, a non-negative integer
specifying the maximum bytes in the `file` part of `POST /upload`, excluding
multipart framing and listing metadata. Absence means unknown capacity, not
unlimited capacity. Clients SHOULD check every intended distribution server's
advertised capacity before provisioning or publishing a listing with a new build.
Servers MUST enforce their limit while receiving file bytes and SHOULD return
HTTP `413` when exceeded. Metadata and total request limits may apply separately.
Discovery is advisory: limits may change before an upload completes.

### `POST /upload`

Developer-authenticated. Uploads a game build.

**Auth:** NIP-98 token; the signer MUST be the developer or a fulfillment key under a currently enabled, active authorization containing `upload_build`.

**Request body (`multipart/form-data`):**
```
listing_event: <JSON of signed kind 30402 event>
file: <binary game archive>
```

**Server MUST:**
1. Verify `listing_event.sig`.
2. Verify direct developer authority or a current listing authorization with active `upload_build` capability.
3. Verify the uploaded file's SHA‑256 matches `file_hash` in `listing_event`.
4. Store the file indexed by `game_coordinate`.

**Response `200`:**
```json
{
  "game_coordinate": "30402:<developer-pubkey>:<d-tag>",
  "file_hash": "<sha256-hex>",
  "download_url": "https://dist.arcadestr.io/game/30402:<developer-pubkey>:<d-tag>"
}
```

### `POST /purchase/confirm`

Buyer-authenticated. Submits payment proof; receives a signed NIP‑102 receipt and a download authorization.

**Auth:** NIP‑98 token. The buyer's identity is derived from the token's `pubkey`; no buyer identity fields are accepted from the request body.

**Request body (`application/json`):**
```json
{
  "game_coordinate": "30402:<developer-pubkey>:<d-tag>",
  "listing_event": { "...": "signed kind 30402 event" },
  "zap_receipt_event": { "...": "signed kind 9735 event" }
}
```

`zap_receipt_event` MAY be replaced with `bolt11` + `preimage` fields, per NIP‑102's payment-proof flexibility.

**Server MUST verify:**

1. NIP‑98 token: `kind = 27235`, correct `u` tag URL, correct `method` tag, timestamp within 60 seconds of server clock.
2. `listing_event.sig` is valid.
3. `listing_event.pubkey` is the expected developer for the claimed `game_coordinate`.
4. The server signs directly as developer, or the current listing references an active authorization for its fulfillment key containing `issue_receipt`.
5. Payment proof is valid: `zap_receipt_event.sig` valid, buyer `P` tag matches the NIP‑98 token pubkey, an `a`/`e` tag references the claimed `game_coordinate` with a matching amount, **and** `zap_receipt_event.pubkey` matches the LSP resolved from the listing's `lud16` tag per [LSP Verification](#lsp-verification-lud16) — or the `bolt11`/`preimage` pair validates per NIP‑102.
6. The payment proof event id has not been used in a prior confirmed purchase (replay protection).

**Server MUST on success:**

1. Generate an `order` id (UUID v4).
2. Construct a `kind:1020` root receipt including public payment binding and, for delegated signing, `authorization` pointing to the exact `kind:30406` root.
3. Encrypt the itemized order JSON to the buyer's pubkey per [NIP‑44](44.md) and set it as `.content`.
4. Sign with the fulfillment key (or developer key) and publish to relays.
5. Persist `(order_id, payment_proof_event_id, buyer_pubkey, game_coordinate)` with a unique constraint on `order_id`, satisfying NIP‑102's idempotency requirement.

**Response `200`:**
```json
{
  "receipt": { "...": "signed kind 1020 event" },
  "download_token": "<opaque-token>",
  "token_expires_at": 1234567890
}
```

**Error responses:**

| Status | Reason |
|---|---|
| `400` | Malformed request body |
| `401` | NIP‑98 token invalid or expired |
| `402` | Payment verification failed (including: zap receipt not signed by the listing's resolved LSP, or listing has no `lud16` and only a zap receipt was presented) |
| `409` | Payment proof already used (replay) |
| `404` | Game not hosted on this server |
| `500` | Server's fulfillment key is not currently authorized for this listing |

### `GET /game/:game_coordinate`

Buyer-authenticated. Streams the game archive. Requires both an ownership check and a distribution-authorization check to pass independently.

**Auth:** NIP‑98 token, or `?token=<download_token>` from `/purchase/confirm`.

#### Ownership check

- **Path A — download token:** valid, unexpired, issued for this `game_coordinate` to this buyer.
- **Path B — receipt query (portable):** query receipts by buyer and coordinate, resolve the receipt chain, and verify either direct developer signing or the immutable `authorization` root at the receipt root's `created_at`. Current listing membership is not required for historical credential validity.

Path B requires no relationship between the purchasing server and the serving server — the receipt and its delegation are independently verifiable by anyone.

#### Distribution authorization

Independent of ownership: the serving server MUST confirm its own URL appears in the listing's `server` tags for this `game_coordinate`. A server not listed there MUST NOT serve the file, regardless of a presented receipt's validity.

**Response `200`:** binary game archive stream.
**Response `304`:** not modified (conditional GET SHOULD be supported).

**Error responses:**

| Status | Reason |
|---|---|
| `403` | Ownership check failed |
| `451` | Server not authorized to distribute this file |

## Trust Model

Ownership proof (the `kind:1020` receipt) and distribution authorization (`server` tags) are deliberately separate. A receipt is self-sovereign: any party can verify it against the listing without trusting the server that issued it. `server` tags are a distinct, developer-controlled allowlist of who may hold and serve copies of the file — a server MUST NOT infer distribution rights from a valid receipt alone, since that would let any node holding a leaked copy of the archive serve it to anyone with proof of purchase, regardless of whether the developer sanctioned that node as a mirror.

## Security Considerations

- **Replay attacks:** servers MUST store canonical identifiers for every supplied proof and reject reuse, even against a different buyer.
- **Receipt forgery:** a portable receipt is an authorized merchant attestation. Public proofs must validate, encrypted BOLT-11/preimage evidence must match the signed payment binding when selectively disclosed, and buyer assertions alone are insufficient.
- **Fulfillment key custody:** every fulfillment key MUST be distinct per developer — an operator serving multiple developers MUST NOT let two developers share a key, since compromising it would compromise every developer behind it at once. Keys must remain online to support non-interactive fulfillment; each key's capability is scoped to signing receipts for its one developer, so compromise doesn't expose that developer's listing-publishing or social identity, and is recoverable prospectively through `kind:30406` cancellation.
- **Multi-tenant key storage:** an operator holding many developers' fulfillment keys MUST encrypt them at rest (e.g. AES-256-GCM under a server-wide master key, at minimum) — this store is now a considerably higher-value target than any single self-hosted key, since its compromise cascades across every developer the operator serves. An operator running at meaningful scale SHOULD evaluate an HSM or KMS rather than relying on a bare master-key secret.
- **Prospective cancellation:** `kind:30406` cancellation is effective at the cancellation event timestamp and cannot invalidate earlier credentials.
- **Authorization completeness:** invalid chains and valid forks fail closed; insufficient relay coverage is indeterminate rather than proof of invalidity.
- **NIP‑98 token scope:** the `u` tag must exactly match the request URL including path; a token for `/purchase/confirm` MUST NOT be accepted for `/game/:id`.
- **File integrity:** `file_hash` is a developer commitment. Servers SHOULD periodically re-verify stored files against it.
- **Encoding canonicality:** hex-valued fields have exactly one valid form (see [Canonical Hex Encoding](#canonical-hex-encoding)). Accepting variants of a value used as a key or compared for equality creates a class of defect in which two representations of the same artifact are treated as distinct, defeating deduplication and producing verification results that depend on which participant performed the comparison.
- **NIP-98 origin binding:** a `u` tag comparison that omits scheme and authority permits cross-origin replay of an otherwise-valid authorization within its validity window. Because ADP servers are interchangeable and several may serve the same coordinate, this is a live risk rather than a theoretical one. Scheme and authority MUST come from configuration, never from request headers.
- **Evidence asymmetry:** applying a relay-completeness threshold to positive findings makes availability depend on the least available relay rather than the most available one, inverting the redundancy relays provide. The threshold belongs on negative findings only; see [Relay availability](#relay-availability).

## Relationship to Other NIPs

| NIP | Role |
|-----|------|
| [NIP-99](99.md) | Classified listing carrying distribution metadata and `fulfillment_authorization` root references |
| [NIP‑102](NIP-102.md) | Marketplace receipt (`kind:1020`) — the ownership credential this protocol relies on |
| [NIP‑98](98.md) | HTTP Auth for all authenticated endpoints |
| [NIP‑44](44.md) | Encryption of receipt `.content` |
| [NIP‑57](57.md) | Zap Request/Receipt as payment proof; its LSP metadata is what [LSP Verification](#lsp-verification-lud16) checks a zap receipt's signer against |

## Implementation Notes

- **`kind:30403` storage:** relays SHOULD retain server announcement events; they are replaceable and low-frequency.
- **Multi-server redundancy:** multiple `server` tags on one listing declare independent, redundant distribution points; none is privileged over another.
- **Version negotiation:** `supported_adp` in `/.well-known/adp` is advisory; no negotiation protocol is defined in this draft.

## Reference Implementation Checklist

For a server to be considered ADP‑01 compliant it SHOULD implement:

- [ ] Serving `/.well-known/adp` and publishing a `kind:30403` announcement.
- [ ] Verifying direct developer upload or current enabled authorization with `upload_build`.
- [ ] Verifying file SHA‑256 against `file_hash` on upload and periodically thereafter.
- [ ] Rejecting non-lowercase hex in every field documented as hex-encoded, rather than normalizing on read.
- [ ] Verifying NIP‑98, listing signature, and payment proof before issuing a receipt in `/purchase/confirm`.
- [ ] Resolving the listing's `lud16` tag (never the developer's profile) to an LSP `nostrPubkey` and confirming the zap receipt was signed by it, before accepting the zap-receipt payment path — see [LSP Verification](#lsp-verification-lud16).
- [ ] Enforcing idempotency on `order` id and replay protection on the payment-proof event id.
- [ ] Signing delegated receipts only under a current enabled authorization containing `issue_receipt`, and embedding its immutable root ID.
- [ ] Implementing `POST /provision` and `POST /provision/revoke` (§[Provisioning Endpoints](#provisioning-endpoints)), publishing a `kind:30404` attestation per provisioned key, with a distinct key per `(developer, scope)` pair — never a key shared across developers.
- [ ] Encrypting stored fulfillment private keys at rest.
- [ ] Resolving authorization chains with valid-prefix semantics and distinguishing invalidity from incomplete relay coverage.
- [ ] Evaluating ownership (Path A/B) and distribution authorization (`server` tags) as independent checks in `/game/:game_coordinate`.
- [ ] Rejecting NIP‑98 tokens whose `u` tag does not match the exact requested path.
- [ ] Comparing NIP-98 `u` tags with scheme and authority from configured origin and path/query verbatim from the raw request, without decoding or normalization.
- [ ] Selecting valid positive evidence from completed relay responses before applying any completeness threshold.

## Experimental split-settlement profile (version 1)

This optional profile uses currently unallocated regular Nostr kinds. It is an
implementation experiment, **not a standardized kind allocation**:

- `kind:1032` is an immutable operator-signed commercial-terms root. It binds
  `version`, operator pubkey, Lightning destination, fee (`none`, positive fixed
  integer msat, or positive integer basis points with optional min/max), and
  limitations. A later revision is a new root. An operator-signed withdrawal
  references a root and stops only new quotes; it cannot alter issued quotes,
  receipts, or ownership.
- `kind:1033` is a private signed processor quote. It binds the buyer, exact
  listing event, accepted terms roots, processor, gross, destination commitment,
  ordered legs, and fixed deadlines. It MUST NOT be published to public relays.
- `kind:1034` is append-only signed incomplete-settlement/refund evidence. It
  never grants ownership. Sensitive recovery fields belong in NIP-44 ciphertext.

Announcements and `/.well-known/adp` advertise version `1`, these experimental
kinds, split support, current terms root, and whether legacy new sales are
accepted. The announcement signer, terms signer, and sale processor MUST be the
same operator pubkey. Multiple URLs signed by that pubkey are one operator, one
accepted root, and at most one fee.

### Consent and pricing

A split-enabled listing MUST contain exactly one valid `adp_terms` reference for
every distinct operator in its `server` set, including operators offering
`none`. Missing, conflicting, forged, withdrawn-at-quote-time, or unverifiable
coverage blocks publication and quote creation. Ordinary listing replacement
preserves references unless the developer explicitly changes them. Listings
without `adp_terms` remain legacy fee-free single-payment listings. An operator
MAY explicitly decline new legacy sales, but MUST NOT infer consent or deduct a
fee. `kind:30406` remains operational authority and is never commercial consent.

Split gross MUST be SAT/SATS or BTC exactly convertible to integer msat. Fiat
requires a future oracle/quote profile. For each operator independently:

`fee = clamp(floor(u128(gross_msat) * basis_points / 10000), min, max)`.

Overflow, non-positive fixed/basis-point values, invalid bounds, or aggregate
operator fees greater than or equal to gross invalidate the quote. The developer
gets the exact remainder. Zero creates no leg. Every positive amount MUST be
invoiced exactly; implementations MUST NOT drop, shift, or round a dust leg.
Leg order is ascending `(amount_msat, role, recipient_pubkey)` and is committed
by the quote.

### Quote activation and payment

Issuance fixes `payment_expires_at = issued_at + 1800` and
`confirmation_expires_at = issued_at + 86400`. A signed quote begins `draft`,
then `preflighting`; it is not payable until the processor validates the buyer's
designated Lightning-address/LNURL-pay endpoint and obtains a processor-controlled
exact invoice for **every** positive leg. The destination's `minSendable` and
`maxSendable` MUST cover every possible per-leg principal refund. Its plaintext
stays private; the quote binds a canonical commitment. A buyer-authorized
replacement preserves history and never resets `failure_at` or extends refund
deadlines.

Each attempt records LNURL origin/callback, LSP pubkey, BOLT-11 payment hash,
expiry, and proof. NIP-57 Zap Requests are buyer-signed and merely forwarded by
the processor. The processor MUST recheck quote state, hard `kind:30406`
cancellation, and listing authorization before disclosing each invoice. It
discloses one invoice at a time in committed order. An expired invoice may be
replaced only for the same unpaid leg, recipient, and amount; all attempts remain
recorded and replacement expiry cannot exceed the confirmation deadline.

No new invoice is disclosed after the payment deadline or after failure. A
disclosed BOLT-11 remains independently payable until its own expiry; later
settlement MUST be recorded and included in recovery obligations. If a required
leg is undisclosed at the payment deadline, `failure_at` equals that deadline.
If all were disclosed and only final proof is pending, proof may arrive until
the confirmation deadline, which becomes `failure_at` on timeout. There is no
partial rollover. A new purchase is wholly independent and cannot reuse a leg.

`POST /purchase/confirm` remains backward-compatible. For version 1 it is
idempotent by quote/purchase identity and verifies quote signature and state,
buyer, exact listing and terms snapshot, current hard authorization, deadlines,
all recipients, amounts, LSPs, invoices, globally unique proofs, aggregate sum,
and NIP-102 commitment. It issues one aggregate receipt and ownership/download
token only after complete settlement. Publication retries reuse that exact root.

### Incomplete settlement and refunds

Failure stops disclosure but never erases late proof. Each paid recipient owes
only principal actually received; the processor coordinates and is not a
guarantor. Routing fees are visible and non-refundable by default. Partial
payment creates no ownership and refunds are not guaranteed.

Principal is due at `failure_at + 604800`. The processor has 3600 seconds after
failure to issue a signed `kind:1034` incomplete claim. Afterwards the buyer may
issue fallback evidence from the quote, proofs, and deterministic failure facts.
Evidence is deduplicated by purchase identity. A late processor claim cannot
invalidate fallback evidence or move the deadline. Each obligation independently
tracks `refund_owed`, `initiated`, `verified`, and `overdue/disputed`, retaining
proof and encrypted destination history.

## Open Questions

- **Authorization propagation latency:** no SLA is defined for observing a new listing enablement or `30406` cancellation.
- **Operator offboarding notification:** operator revocation should notify the developer so the developer can cancel `30406` and remove listing enablement.
- **Legacy refunds:** no refund flow is defined for the legacy single-payment profile. The experimental split profile above defines recovery evidence without guaranteeing recipient cooperation.
